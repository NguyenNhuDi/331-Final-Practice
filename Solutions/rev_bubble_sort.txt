The runtime is: O(n^2)

INNER LOOP
================================
Termination:
For every iteration j is incremented. This means that eventually the loop
condition j < A.size() will be broken without side effects since the size of A
was not changed and no external call was made. Therefore the inner loop will 
always terminate.
